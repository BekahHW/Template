# Introduction

Thank you for so much for considering contributing to this repostory. We really appreciate all the contributors who try to make this space better.

### Why we made this doc.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. 
In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We also want to make it as easy as possible for newbies to start helping out and docs like this provide a valuable resource for them to use.

### What type of contributions we're looking for.

This is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, 
from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests,
or writing code which can be incorporated into the application codebase itself


N/A right now.

# Ground Rules
### How our contributor community is organized

Please see our Code of Conduct for more info.

# Your First Contribution
Help people who are new to your project understand where they can be most helpful. This is also a good time to let people know if you follow a label convention for flagging beginner issues.

Unsure where to begin contributing to Atom? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues:
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues.
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have.

### Never done open source before?
Here are a couple of friendly tutorials you can include: http://makeapullrequest.com/ and http://www.firsttimersonly.com/

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this *free* series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

At this point, you're ready to make your changes! Feel free to ask for help; everyone is a beginner at first :smile_cat:

For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

- Create an issue if one doesnt already exist of the problem you'd like to address
- Create your own fork of the code
- Do the changes in your fork
- If you like the change and think the project could use it, Send a pull request indicating that you have a CLA on file.


# How to report a bug
### A note on security
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email kirk.shilling@gmail.com instead.


### Bug report template
We have a bug report template already created for your use. Just select when opening up an issue on github

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these three questions:

- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?


### Feature Process

If you find yourself wishing for a feature you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. 
Open an issue on our issues list on GitHub which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

# Code review process
### How does a contribution get accepted

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a weekly basis.
After feedback has been given we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

# Community

All community discussions are currently done via issues.

# Additional Info

### Preferred Code style

Coming Eventually!

### Commit message conventions

We tend to use a `Type:Description` style for commit messages so it's easy to see what type of change is being made.
Common types are:
- DOCS - Creating of new documents
- FIX - Bug fixes
- EDIT - Usually a follow up commit if a small error was spotted in a previous version
- REFACTOR 

### Labelling Conventions

Coming soon!
